Loqate is a company of GBG (https://www.loqate.com/en-gb/).

We provide SaaS services that perform mainly Address Verification, along with other services such as Phone and Email.

Here is our developer API documentation that shows users how to integrate our services from scratch (https://www.loqate.com/resources/support/apis/capture/).

Our salesforce integration builds an interface to this so that customers can get going quicker.

All API's that you find in the integration are the same ones used publicly by our customers.

The api endpoints pass the key that is stored in the integration settings, note that this does not expose any private information of our customers 
and the key is just our way of allowing someone with an account to use the services we provide.

Generally we encourage customers to put url restrictions on the key that can be done in our account section that we provide to them. This helps with their security and will be processed server side.

There are no services in this integration that returns information about the customer that could identify an individual or expose personal information. The api's used will only return information that relates to the service purpose; to find and retrieve addresses.
